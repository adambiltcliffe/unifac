<h1>The Last Adventurer: Tips</h1>
</header>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There's a lot of info I didn't have time to work into in-game instructions, so read this if
you feel like there's something you don't understand.

<p>Basically you control
a band of five adventurers, and after each quest, your party gets one smaller. The last quest is a
solo quest.

<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select by left-clicking or clicking and dragging
<li>Press A to select all/none
<li>Press TAB to cycle through all adventurers
<li>Press LEFT and RIGHT to rotate the game
<li>Left-click on the ground to send selected adventurer(s)
<li>Left-click on an enemy to move to them (will attack automatically)
<li>Press SPACE (after completing the first quest) to cast a spell
<li>Cheat Mode: press BACKSPACE on the title screen to reach the upgrade screen
<li>Cheat Mode: press 0 (zero) on the upgrade screen to get free XP!
</ul>

<h2>Quests</h2>
<p>There are five quests in the game. The first two are training, and the last three end in boss
battles.

<dl>
<dt>Quest for the Lost Spells <dd>Uncover the ancient forgotten spellbooks. After completing this quest,
the four remaining members of your party will be able to cast spells with the space bar. Make sure
you collect as much XP as possible (grey dots) in order to buy upgrades after your quest.
<dt>Quest for the Crystal Key <dd>To unlock the Cavern of Ryor, you must destroy a crystal standing
outside it. The crystal only takes magical damage, so use your new spells to destroy it. Select one
adventurer, and then point to the crystal and press Space Bar. Watch your MP meter, which you can
fill by collecting yellow dots.
<dt>The Cavern of Ryor <dd>I don't even know. Some cavern I guess? Maybe there's ghosts at the end?
<dt>Zoltar's Lair <dd>Zoltar is a gelatinous cube that eats warriors in a village.
<dt>The Last Adventure <dd>The ghosts of Ryor are back with some new tricks.
</dl>

<h2>Character stats</h2>

<p>After you've collected XP in a quest, you can use it to upgrade your party members in five areas:
HP, MP, strength, speed, and range. I recommend upgrading heavily on strength and MP. Strength
controls both the strength of your regular attack and your magical attack.

<p>As a tip, the adventurer that gets removed after each quest is whichever one has had the most
amount of XP spent on upgrades, so you're encouraged to upgrade your party evenly. The amount of XP
spent on each character can be found in the lower-right corner of their upgrade box.

<h2>Spells</h2>

<p>There are three different magical spells. They're meant to be balanced but I probably didn't do
a very good job. Each character is only able to cast a single spell.

<ul>
<li>Bolt (5MP) - an instant bolt of lightning. It packs the most powerful punch in a single blow,
and it has a medium area of effect, but it's got the highest cost of the three spells.
<li>Quake (3MP) - not as damaging on a single enemy, but it has a huge area of effect, so it's great
for taking out rooms of enemies. It also takes a couple of seconds to cast.
<li>Drain (3MP) - the most damage per MP usage, plus you get to eat your enemy's HP! The downside
is that it only affects a single enemy.
</ul>

<h2>Story (which doesn't appear in the game)</h2>

<p>I figured a lot of games in this challenge would be about the positive or negative aspects of
solitude, so I wanted to avoid one side or the other of that, so I wound up just leaving the story
out. I avoided the emotional side of being alone and instead focused on how it affected the game
mechanics. I thought of a story to explain why all the adventurers keep leaving, but it was really
depressing and I couldn't think of a way to make it better.

<p>In the story, when there are only two adventurers left, and one of them decides to leave, they
reveal that all the adventurers are really just children on a playground acting out a fantasy, and
they leave when they outgrow it. The scene with the two of this is really poignant. The one who
leaves goes, "I'm sorry, my mom told me I'm too old to play make-believe with you anymore. She also
said that your mom would have said the same thing if she were still here."

<p>It's probably best I didn't try to make that work.

<h2>About the Game</h2>

<p>This game was made from scratch in 48 hours for the 22nd Ludum Dare. The sound effects were
made with <a herf="http://www.superflashbros.net/as3sfxr/">a3sfxr</a> and the music was generated
by Autotracker-C by Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russel.

<p>The theme was "Alone".
I thought about how you always start out RPGs alone and build up a party until the end
of the game where you face the final foe together, and I thought, what if it went the other way?
<p>Now, I didn't have time to make a whole RPG, so this is just an action game with some RPG elements.
<p>The game is made completely with HTML5+Javascript using the canvas element and the GameJS library.
It should work on all modern browsers (I think even Internet Explorer 10?) but I haven't tested it
on anything but Firefox 8 yet.
