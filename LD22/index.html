<h1>Last Adventurer Standing</h1>
    <p>
      An HTML5 game by <a href="http://christophernight.net">Christopher Night</a>.

<p>This game was made from scratch in 48 hours for the 22nd Ludum Dare. The theme was "Alone"
<p>I started thinking about how you always start out RPGs alone and build up a party until the end
of the game where you face the final foe together, and I thought, what if it went the other way?
So in this game you start with a large party and every chapter you lose a member of your party until
you have just one adventurer left.
<p>Now, I don't have time to make a whole RPG, so this is an action game with some RPG elements.
